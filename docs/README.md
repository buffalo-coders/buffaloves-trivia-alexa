# Website - Github Pages

This is the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) source for our [webpage](https://buffalo-coders.github.io/buffaloves-trivia-alexa/).

You can run the site builder locally if you have Docker installed. Just invoke the `docker-jekyll` script to invoke any arbitrary Jekyll command, or `docker-jekyll-serve` to build and serve up the pages without having to rebuild. Once serve is launched, open the site on [http://localhost:4000].
