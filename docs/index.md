## Why Alexa?

Amazon Alexa is available on over [one hundred million](https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-has-sold-more-than-100-million-alexa-devices/) devices around the world, giving us access to a huge number of potential users. Alexa is powered by the Amazon [cloud of computing services](https://aws.amazon.com/products/), providing a wealth of other on-demand, infinitely scalable services to potentially increase BuffaLoves Trivia's capabilities. And, last but not least, it was just fun to pick up this technology and try to do something useful with it!

## Why Buffalo?

Whether Buffalo is your hometown or just your current [tourist destination](https://www.visitbuffaloniagara.com/), play the Buffaloves Trivia game to quiz yourself about all things Buffalo. The city is more than just the home of the [chicken wing](https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/chicken-wing-history/), it has a long and storied history going back [over 200 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York). It has been the [birthplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millard_Fillmore), and [deathplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_William_McKinley), of [US presidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Buffalo,_New_York#U.S._Presidents_and_Buffalo), the host of a [World's Fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-American_Exposition), and is a [major gateway](https://www.bts.gov/content/border-crossingentry-data) into the United States.

No matter if you call it The Queen City, The City of Good Neighbors, The Nickel City, Queen City of the Lakes, or City of Light, we all know it as our Buffalo.

## Origin Story

This project was produced as part of a [Hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) called [Code:Buffalo](https://www.43north.org/code-buffalo/) sponsored by our good friends over at [43 North](https://www.43north.org/), [Techstars](https://www.techstars.com/), [M&T Bank](https://www.mtb.com/home-page), [ACV Auctions](https://www.acvauctions.com/), and the [University at Buffalo](http://www.buffalo.edu/). Thanks for inspiring us to take on this project!

## Challenges

The Alexa stack was new and challenging technology for us to use. There's a real disconnect between development and testing when you have to install the application onto a 3rd party service. Also, when other technological components are added in like Amazon serverless Lambda functions, and a future serverless NoSQL database for leaderboard checking.. it really was a lot of new things to learn simultaneously.
